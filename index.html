        <p>You know Shakespeare once said</p>
         <em>“Where there is noise higher than a yawn </em>
        <br> <em>than how caneth an idea possibly be drawn”</em>

Lets just say I didn't have the <strong>best </strong> experience being in a loud environment whilst trying to study/learn.<!-- elaborate here -->  </p>
